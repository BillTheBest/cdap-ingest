=============================
CDAP Stream Client for Python
=============================

The Stream Client Python API is for managing Streams from Python applications.


Supported Actions
=================

- Create a Stream
- Update TTL (time-to-live) for an existing Stream
- Retrieve the current Stream TTL
- Truncate an existing Stream (the deletion of all events that were written to the Stream)
- Write an event to an existing Stream


Installation
============

To install the CDAP Stream Client, run::

  $ pip install cdap-stream-client

To install the development version, clone the repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-ingest.git
  $ cd cdap-ingest/cdap-stream-clients/python/
  $ python setup.py install

Supported Python versions: 2.6, 2.7

Usage
=====

To use the Stream Client Python API, include these imports in your Python script::

  from cdap_stream_client import Config
  from cdap_stream_client import StreamClient


Examples
========

Creating a StreamClient
-----------------------
Create a StreamClient instance with default parameters::

  stream_client = StreamClient()

Optional configurations that can be set (and their default values):

- ``host``: ``localhost``
- ``port``: ``10000``
- ``namespace``: ``default``
- ``ssl``: ``False`` (set to ``True`` to use HTTPS protocol)
- ``ssl_cert_check``: ``True`` (set to ``False`` to suspend certificate checks; this allows self-signed
  certificates when SSL is ``True``)
- ``authClient``: ``null`` (`CDAP Authentication Client
  <https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-clients/tree/develop/cdap-authentication-clients/python>`__
  to interact with a secure CDAP instance)

Example::

  config = Config()
  config.host = 'localhost'
  config.port = 10000
  config.namespace = example
  config.ssl = True
  config.set_auth_client(authentication_client)

  stream_client = StreamClient(config)


Creating a Stream
-----------------
Create a new Stream with the ``stream-id`` *newStreamName*::

    stream_client.create("newStreamName")

**Notes:**

- The ``stream-id`` should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.

Creating a StreamWriter
-----------------------
Create a ``StreamWriter`` instance for writing events to the Stream *streamName*:

    stream_writer = stream_client.create_writer("streamName")

Writing Stream Events
---------------------
To write new events to the Stream, use the ``write`` method of the ``StreamWriter`` class::

  def write(self, message, charset=None, headers=None)

Example::

  stream_promise = stream_writer.write("New stream event")

Truncating a Stream
-------------------
To delete all events that were written to the Stream *streamName*, use::

    stream_client.truncate("streamName")

Updating Stream Time-to-Live (TTL)
----------------------------------
Update TTL for the Stream *streamName*::

    stream_client.set_ttl("streamName", newTTL)

Getting Stream Time-to-Live (TTL)
---------------------------------
Get the current TTL value for the Stream *streamName*::

    ttl = stream_client.get_ttl("streamName")

StreamPromise
-------------
``StreamPromise``'s goal is to implement deferred code execution.

For error handling, create a handler for each case and set it using the ``onResponse``
method. The error handling callback function is optional.

Example::

  def on_ok_response(response):
      ...
      parse response
      ...

  def on_error_response(response):
      ...
      parse response
      ...

  stream_promise = stream_writer.write("New stream event")
  stream_promise.on_response(on_ok_response, on_error_response)
