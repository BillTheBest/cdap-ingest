=================================
CDAP Stream Client for JavaScript
=================================

The Stream Client JavaScript API is for managing Streams via external JavaScript applications.

Supported Actions
=================

- Create a Stream with a specified *stream-id*
- Update TTL for an existing Stream with a specified *stream-id*
- Retrieve the current Stream TTL for a specified *stream-id*
- Truncate an existing Stream (the deletion of all events that were written to the Stream)
- Write an event to an existing Stream specified by *stream-id*


Usage
=====

To use the Stream Client JavaScript API, include these imports in your JavaScript script:

Browser
-------

::

  <script src="cdap-stream-client.min.js"></script>

NodeJS
------

::

  var StreamClient = require('cdap-stream-client');


Examples
--------

**Note:** All methods return ``Promise`` objects. Use the ``then``, ``catch``, and
``notify`` methods of ``Promise`` to interact with the returned data.

Create a ``StreamClient`` instance, specifying the fields 'host' and 'port' of the gateway
server. Optional configurations that can be set (and their default values):

- ``ssl: false`` (use HTTP protocol)
- ``authManager: null`` (a reference to the AutheticationManager)

::

   config = {
       host: 'localhost',
       port: 10000
   }

   var streamClient = new StreamClient(config)


Create a new Stream with the *stream-id* "newStreamName"::

  streamClient.create("newStreamName");

**Notes:**
- The *stream-id* can only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.

Update TTL for the Stream "streamName"; ``newTTL`` is a long value::

   var ttlPromise = streamClient.setTTL("streamName", newTTL);
   ttlPromise.then(function onOk(ttlValue) {
     //TTL has been set up. 
   }, function onError(statusCode) {
     //actions on error
   });


Get the current TTL value for the Stream "streamName"::

   var ttlPromise = streamClient.getTTL("streamName");
   ttlPromise.then(function onOk(ttlValue) {
     //use TTL value
   }, function onError(statusCode) {
     //actions on error
   });


Create a ``StreamWriter`` instance for writing events to the Stream "streamName"::

   var streamWriterPromise = streamClient.createWriter("streamName");
   streamWriterPromise.then(function(writer){
       console.log('new writer instance has been created:', writer);
   })

To write new events to the Stream, you can use either of these these methods of the
``StreamWriter`` class::

   write({
         message,
         [headers = {}]
         })

Example::

   var streamWriter = streamClient.createWriter("streamName");
   streamWriter.then(function(writer){
       writer.write("Many messages sent to stream.");
       writer.write("Another message sent to stream.");
       writer.write("Multiple messages sent to stream.");
   })

To truncate the Stream *streamName*, use::

   var truncatePromise = streamClient.truncate("streamName");
   truncatePromise.then(function () {
       console.log('truncated successfully');
   });


StreamPromise
-------------
 
StreamPromise's goal is to implement deferred code execution.

For error handling, create a handler for each case and set it using the ``then`` method.

Example::

  var onOkHandlerr = function onOkHandler(httpResponse) {
      ...
      parse response
      ...
  }

  var onErrorHandler = function onErrorHandler(httpResponse) {
      ...
      parse response
      ...
  }

  streamPromise.then(onOkResponse, onErrorResponse)


Additional Notes
================

All methods from the ``StreamClient`` and ``StreamWriter`` return errors using
``Promise``\ s. Please use ``Promise``\ 's ``catch`` method to interact with errors. These
errors help determine if the request was processed successfully or not.

In the case of a **200 OK** response, no error will be thrown; in other cases, HTTP status
code will be returned.
