===========================
CDAP Stream Client for Ruby
===========================

The Stream Client Ruby API is a tool for managing Streams via external custom Ruby applications.

Supported Actions
=================

- Create a Stream with a specified <stream-id>
- Update TTL for an exiting Stream with a specified <stream-id>
- Retrieve the current Stream TTL for a specified <stream-id>
- Truncate an existing Stream (the deletion of all events that were written to the Stream)
- Write an event to an existing Stream

Build
=====

To build a gem, run::

  gem build stream-client-ruby.gemspec


Usage
=====

To use the Stream Client Ruby API, just add to your application Gemfile::

  gem 'stream-client-ruby'


If you use gem outside Rails, you should require gem files in your application files::

  require 'stream-client-ruby'


Example
=======

You can configure ``StreamClient`` settings in your config files. For example::

  # config/stream.yml
  gateway: 'localhost'
  port: 10000
  api_version: 'v3'
  namespace: 'example'
  api_key:
  ssl: false

  # initializers/stream.rb
  require "yaml"

  config = YAML.load_file("config/stream.yml")

  CDAPIngest::Rest.gateway     = config['gateway']
  CDAPIngest::Rest.port        = config['port']
  CDAPIngest::Rest.api_version = config['api_version']
  CDAPIngest::Rest.namespace   = config['namespace']
  CDAPIngest::Rest.ssl         = config['ssl']


Create a StreamClient instance and use it as any Ruby object::

  client = CDAPIngest::StreamClient.new


If authentication is required, set authentication client::

  client.set_auth_client auth_client


Create a new Stream with the *stream-id* "new_stream_name"::

  client.create "new_stream_name"


Notes:

- The <stream-id> must only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.


Update TTL for the Stream *stream_name*; TTL is a integer value such as 256::

  client.set_ttl stream_name, 256


Get the current TTL value for the Stream *stream_name*::

  ttl = client.get_ttl "stream_name"


Create a ``StreamWriter`` instance for writing events to the Stream *stream_name* in 3
threads asynchronously::

  writer = client.create_writer "stream_name", 3


To write new events to the Stream, you can use code::

  test_data = "string to send in stream 10 times"

  10.times {
    writer.write(test_data).then(
      ->(response) {
        puts "success: #{response.code}"
      },
      ->(error) {
        puts "error: #{error.response.code} -> #{error.message}"
      }
    )
  }



To truncate the Stream *stream_name*, use::

  client.truncate "stream_name"


When you are finished, release all resources by calling this method::

  writer.close


Additional Notes
================

All methods from the ``StreamClient`` and ``StreamWriter`` throw exceptions using response
code analysis from the gateway server. These exceptions help determine if the request was
processed successfully or not.

In the case of a ``200 OK`` response, no exception will be thrown; other cases will throw
these exceptions:

- ``400``: The request had a combination of parameters that is not recognized
- ``401``: The request did not contain an authentication token
- ``403``: The request was authenticated but the client does not have permission
- ``404``: The request did not address any of the known URIs
- ``405``: A request was received with a method not supported for the URI
- ``409``: A request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current resource state
- ``500``: An internal error occurred while processing the request
- ``501``: A request contained a query that is not supported by this API


Testing
=======

To launch unit tests only, execute::

  rspec --tag ~it


To launch integration tests against a Standalone CDAP instance, execute::

  rspec --tag type:it-local


To launch integration tests against a Standalone CDAP instance with authentication enabled,
execute::

  rspec --tag type:it-local-auth


To launch integration tests against a Standalone CDAP instance with authentication enabled
and SSL turned on, execute::

  rspec --tag type:it-local-auth-ssl
