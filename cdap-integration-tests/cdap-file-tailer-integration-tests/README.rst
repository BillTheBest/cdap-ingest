===================================================================
Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) File Tailer Integration Tests
===================================================================

This project contains integration tests for the CDAP File Tailer.

*Note*: The File Tailer is no longer supported for CDAP 3.0. Most likely, it will still
work, but because File Tailer is not aware of CDAP Namespaces, it would only work with
the default namespace.
